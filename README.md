## Summary
I created a mini RPG game inspired by one of my favorite cartoon shows, Adventure Time. 

The assignment was to create a game, using jQuery, that would allow you to fight two characters against each other. The catch is that the character you choose to play as gets stronger and stronger each time they attack. 

In the future, I would like to add more complex battle mechanics. Currently, each character hits each other until one dies. Thats boring! I would like to add different types of attacks and different, possibly utilizing a rock-paper-scissors-like balance.
